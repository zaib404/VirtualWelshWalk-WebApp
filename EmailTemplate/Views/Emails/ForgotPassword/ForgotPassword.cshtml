    Hello @Model.Name,
</p>

<p>
    You told us that you forgot the password for your Walking Wales account. Use the button below to reset it. 
    <a class="font-weight-bold">
    This link is only valid for one hour.
    After that, you'll have to ask for a new one.
    </a>
</p>

<br />

@await Html.PartialAsync("EmailButton", new EmailButtonViewModel("Reset your password", Model.ConfirmEmailUrl))

<br />

<p>If you did not request a password reset, please ignore this email or, you can change your password by logging in to your account.</p>
