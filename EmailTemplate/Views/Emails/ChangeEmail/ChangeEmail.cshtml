    Hello @Model.Name,
</p>

<p>
    You recently requested to change your email for your Walking Wales account. Use the button below to change it.
    <a style="font-weight:bold">
        This link is only valid for one hour. After that, you'll have to ask for a new one.
    </a>
</p>

<br />

@await Html.PartialAsync("EmailButton", new EmailButtonViewModel("Change your email", Model.ConfirmEmailUrl))

<p>If you did not request to change your email, please ignore this email.</p>
<br />
